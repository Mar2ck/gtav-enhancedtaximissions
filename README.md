# GTA V - Enhanced Taxi Missions
A ScriptHookVDotNet mod for Grand Theft Auto V, which aims to improve the taxi driver minigame.



#Features
- Random number of passengers for each trip (between 1 and 3)
- 178 individual pick-up and drop-off locations
- Pick-up locations and destinations change depending on the time of day
- Taxi missions can be played in the following vehicles: Taxi, Stretch, Schafter, Oracle, Washington, Super Drop.
- Player is paid based on distance between pick-up and drop-off locations. Base fare is $6, and every additional mile driven is $25.

#Planned Features
- Many more locations
- Tip payments based on performance (vehicle damage state, speed of pick-up, speed of arrival)
- Celebrity passengers (who tip better)
- Random special missions (e.g. drive Epsilon members from HQ to tracts/drive Celeb to movie premiere/passenger needs to catch a plane at the airport)

#In-Game
- Press the "L" key to toggle the missions on and off
- If a passenger gets stuck while trying to get into the vehicle, you can use the horn once to get the passenger to retry entering the vehicle. If it still doesn't work, toggle the missions off and on to reset.

#Contributions
...are welcome. This is my first gitHub project, still learning the ropes. I'm also a casual programmer, so my code may not be the prettiest to look at!

# GTA V - Enhanced Taxi Missions
A ScriptHookVDotNet mod for Grand Theft Auto V, which aims to improve the taxi driver minigame.



#Features

#Contributions
...are welcome. This is my first gitHub project, still learning the ropes. I'm also a casual programmer, so my code may not be the prettiest to look at!
